# NB-Text-Classifier-Tfidf
# Text Classifier Demo using Streamlit and Naive Bayes

Description:
Built a Text Classifier Demo using Streamlit and Naive Bayes, which allows you to classify news headlines into one of five categories: Tech, Business, Sports, Entertainment, or Politics. The app uses a dataset of news headlines from the BBC, which has been preprocessed and labeled.

Instructions:
Access the Text Classifier Demo through the Streamlit link provided.
Enter the news headline you wish to classify into the input box.
Click the "Check" button to see the predicted category.

Technical details:
The app was built using Streamlit, a Python framework for building interactive web apps, and Scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning. The app uses a Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification, and a TfidfVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features. The app was trained on a preprocessed and labeled dataset of news headlines from the BBC, and it is able to classify new headlines into one of five categories with high accuracy.
